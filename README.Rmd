`cypher`: an `R` package for coding secret messages

# Installation

```{r eval = F}
devtools::install_github("derekmichaelwright/cypher")
```

```{r}
library(cypher)
```

# Code Message

```{r}
xx <- cypher_code("This is a secret coded message")
xx
```

# Decoded Message

```{r}
cypher_decode(xx)
```

---

# Personalize

A custom cypher for this package can be recreated using the following code. However, it should be noted that the recipient will need the `Data/cyphers.RData` file to decode the messages.

```{r eval = F}
cyphers <- list()
for(i in 1:999) {
  cyphers[i] <- paste(round(runif(1000, 0, 9)),collapse = "")
}
save(cyphers, file = "Data/cyphers.RData")
```
